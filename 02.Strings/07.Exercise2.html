You have two numbers, the first, is the original price, the second, is the discounted price.

You need to work out what percentage a user saves if they purchase at the second price.

Original price - 25,
New price - 10
</pre>
<script>
    var originalPrice=25;
    var discountedPrice=10;

    console.log("Saved: " + (originalPrice-discountedPrice)/originalPrice*100 + "%");
</script>
